# "Week One:Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of various computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet. It allows for on-demand access to computing resources without the need for managing physical hardware2.

## Basic Computing Concepts
Computer: An electronic device that processes data.

Hardware: Physical components of a computer (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage).

Software: Programs and operating systems that run on hardware.

Data vs. Information: Data is raw, unorganized facts; information is processed data that is meaningful.

## Advantages of Cloud Computing
Cost Savings: Reduces the need for physical hardware and maintenance.

Scalability: Easily scales resources up or down based on demand.

Flexibility: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

Disaster Recovery: Provides backup and recovery solutions.

Speed: Quick deployment of services and applications.

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)
AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, and databases.

## AWS Pricing
AWS uses a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for what you use. There are various pricing options, including On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances6.

## AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
AWS S3 is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It's used for storing and managing data for various applications7.

## AWS Service Categories
AWS offers services across several categories, including:

Compute: Services like EC2, Lambda, and Elastic Beanstalk.

Storage: Services like S3, EBS, and Glacier.

Database: Services like RDS, DynamoDB, and Redshift.

Networking: Services like VPC, Route 53, and Direct Connect.

Security: Services like IAM, Cognito, and Shield.

## AWS Elastic Compute (EC2)
Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to run virtual servers and scale up or down as needed6.

## Introduction to Amazon EC2
Amazon EC2 offers a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases. It supports various pricing models, including On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances6.

# Week Two: Linux


## Introduction to Amazon Linux
Amazon Linux is a Linux distribution provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's optimized for performance and security on AWS infrastructure, designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for applications running on Amazon EC2.

## Linux Command Line
The Linux command line, accessed via a terminal, allows users to interact with the system through text-based commands. Common commands include:

'''
ls: List directory contents

cd: Change directory

pwd: Print working directory

cp, mv, rm: Copy, move, and remove files

cat, less, grep: Display and search file content

'''

## Linux Users and Groups
Linux is a multi-user system, with each user having a unique user ID. Groups help manage permissions for multiple users. Common commands:

useradd, usermod, userdel: Add, modify, delete users

groupadd, groupmod, groupdel: Manage groups

chmod, chown: Change file permissions and ownership

## Editing Files in Linux
Editing files in Linux can be done using text editors like vi, nano, and gedit. Basic commands for vi:

i: Enter insert mode

Esc: Exit insert mode

:w: Save changes

:q: Quit

:wq: Save and quit

## Working with Linux Files
Managing files includes tasks like creating, copying, moving, and deleting files. Useful commands:

touch: Create an empty file

mkdir: Create a directory

cp, mv, rm: Copy, move, remove files and directories

find: Search for files

## Managing File Permissions
File permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file. Command examples:

ls -l: Display file permissions

chmod: Change file permissions (e.g., chmod 755 file)

chown: Change file owner (e.g., chown user:group file)

## Managing Linux Processes
Processes are instances of running programs. Useful commands:

ps: Display active processes

top, htop: Real-time process monitoring

kill: Terminate a process (e.g., kill 1234)

bg, fg: Manage background and foreground processes

## Managing Linux Services
Services are background processes managed by the system. Commands to manage services:

systemctl start/stop/restart service: Control services

systemctl enable/disable service: Enable or disable service at boot

systemctl status service: Check service status

## The Bash Shell
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular command-line interpreter for Unix/Linux systems. It allows users to execute commands, create scripts, and automate tasks.

## Bash Shell Scripting
Bash scripting involves writing scripts to automate tasks. Basics:

Shebang (#!/bin/bash): Specifies the script interpreter

Variables: variable=value

Control Structures: if, for, while

Functions: Define reusable code blocks

## Linux Software Management
Managing software involves installing, updating, and removing packages. Tools vary by distribution:

apt, dpkg: Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu)

yum, rpm: Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS)

zypper: SUSE systems

## Managing Log Files
Log files store system and application event records. Tools for managing logs:

journalctl: View systemd logs

/var/log/: Directory containing log files

tail, less, grep: View and search logs
