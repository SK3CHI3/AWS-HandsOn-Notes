# Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of various computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet. It allows for on-demand access to computing resources without the need for managing physical hardware2.

## Basic Computing Concepts
Computer: An electronic device that processes data.

Hardware: Physical components of a computer (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage).

Software: Programs and operating systems that run on hardware.

Data vs. Information: Data is raw, unorganized facts; information is processed data that is meaningful.

## Advantages of Cloud Computing
Cost Savings: Reduces the need for physical hardware and maintenance.

Scalability: Easily scales resources up or down based on demand.

Flexibility: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

Disaster Recovery: Provides backup and recovery solutions.

Speed: Quick deployment of services and applications.

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)
AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, and databases.

## AWS Pricing
AWS uses a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for what you use. There are various pricing options, including On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances6.

## AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
