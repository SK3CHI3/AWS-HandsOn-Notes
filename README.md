# "Week One:Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of various computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet. It allows for on-demand access to computing resources without the need for managing physical hardware2.

## Basic Computing Concepts
Computer: An electronic device that processes data.

Hardware: Physical components of a computer (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage).

Software: Programs and operating systems that run on hardware.

Data vs. Information: Data is raw, unorganized facts; information is processed data that is meaningful.

## Advantages of Cloud Computing
Cost Savings: Reduces the need for physical hardware and maintenance.

Scalability: Easily scales resources up or down based on demand.

Flexibility: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

Disaster Recovery: Provides backup and recovery solutions.

Speed: Quick deployment of services and applications.

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)
AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, and databases.

## AWS Pricing
AWS uses a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for what you use. There are various pricing options, including On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances6.

## AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
AWS S3 is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It's used for storing and managing data for various applications7.

## AWS Service Categories
AWS offers services across several categories, including:

Compute: Services like EC2, Lambda, and Elastic Beanstalk.

Storage: Services like S3, EBS, and Glacier.

Database: Services like RDS, DynamoDB, and Redshift.

Networking: Services like VPC, Route 53, and Direct Connect.

Security: Services like IAM, Cognito, and Shield.

## AWS Elastic Compute (EC2)
Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to run virtual servers and scale up or down as needed6.

## Introduction to Amazon EC2
Amazon EC2 offers a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases. It supports various pricing models, including On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances6.

# Week Two: Linux


## Introduction to Amazon Linux
Amazon Linux is a Linux distribution provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's optimized for performance and security on AWS infrastructure, designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for applications running on Amazon EC2.

## Linux Command Line
The Linux command line, accessed via a terminal, allows users to interact with the system through text-based commands. Common commands include:

'''
> ls: List directory contents

> cd: Change directory

> pwd: Print working directory

> cp, mv, rm: Copy, move, and remove files

> cat, less, grep: Display and search file content

'''

## Linux Users and Groups
Linux is a multi-user system, with each user having a unique user ID. Groups help manage permissions for multiple users. Common commands:

> useradd, usermod, userdel: Add, modify, delete users

> groupadd, groupmod, groupdel: Manage groups

> chmod, chown: Change file permissions and ownership

## Editing Files in Linux
Editing files in Linux can be done using text editors like vi, nano, and gedit. Basic commands for vi:

> i: Enter insert mode

> Esc: Exit insert mode

> :w: Save changes

> :q: Quit

> :wq: Save and quit

## Working with Linux Files
Managing files includes tasks like creating, copying, moving, and deleting files. Useful commands:

> touch: Create an empty file

> mkdir: Create a directory

> cp, mv, rm: Copy, move, remove files and directories

> find: Search for files

## Managing File Permissions
File permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file. Command examples:

> ls -l: Display file permissions

> chmod: Change file permissions (e.g., chmod 755 file)

> chown: Change file owner (e.g., chown user:group file)

## Managing Linux Processes
Processes are instances of running programs. Useful commands:

> ps: Display active processes

> top, htop: Real-time process monitoring

> kill: Terminate a process (e.g., kill 1234)

> bg, fg: Manage background and foreground processes

## Managing Linux Services
Services are background processes managed by the system. Commands to manage services:

- systemctl start/stop/restart service: Control services

- systemctl enable/disable service: Enable or disable service at boot

- systemctl status service: Check service status

## The Bash Shell
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular command-line interpreter for Unix/Linux systems. It allows users to execute commands, create scripts, and automate tasks.

## Bash Shell Scripting
Bash scripting involves writing scripts to automate tasks. Basics:

- Shebang (#!/bin/bash): Specifies the script interpreter

Variables: variable=value

- Control Structures: if, for, while

Functions: Define reusable code blocks

## Linux Software Management
Managing software involves installing, updating, and removing packages. Tools vary by distribution:

> apt, dpkg: Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu)

> yum, rpm: Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS)

> zypper: SUSE systems

## Managing Log Files
Log files store system and application event records. Tools for managing logs:

> journalctl: View systemd logs

> /var/log/: Directory containing log files

> tail, less, grep: View and search logs

# Week Three: Networking

## Introduction to Networking
Networking refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. It enables communication between devices and can be as simple as two computers connected with a cable or as complex as the internet.

## Networking Concepts
Network: A group of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other.

- LAN (Local Area Network): A network that covers a small geographic area, like a home or office.

- WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that covers a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even globally.

## Protocols: Rules and conventions for communication between network devices (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).

## Internet Protocol (IP)
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules for routing and addressing packets of data so they can travel across networks and reach the correct destination. IP addresses are unique numerical labels assigned to each device on a network.

## Networking in the AWS Cloud
 -AWS provides a suite of networking services to help build and manage cloud networks:

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolated cloud resources for secure network configuration.

- Route 53: Scalable DNS web service.

Direct Connect: Dedicated network connection to AWS.

## IP Subnetting
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). Each subnet has a unique range of IP addresses. This enhances security and improves network performance by reducing broadcast traffic.

## Additional Networking Protocols
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable data transfer between devices.

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Allows faster, but less reliable data transfer.

- HTTP/HTTPS: Protocols for accessing and transmitting web pages securely.

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between devices.

## Additional Networking Technologies
- VPN (Virtual Private Network): Creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.

- Firewalls: Security systems that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

- Load Balancers: Distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance
